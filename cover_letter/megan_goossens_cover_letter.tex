\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,} 
 
I am writing to apply for the position of {Development Intern} as advertised on
{LinkedIn}, for which I have enclosed my most up-to-date resume.

I consider myself as a highly capable Software Engineer with an array of
credentials to support this statement. Complementing my diverse skill set, I
have developed an excellent understanding of a wide range of programming
languages and tools and have demonstrated this capability throughout my ongoing
Computer Science degree from Oregon State University, which I completed in June
of 2019.

While pursuing my education, I have been recognized for my outstanding ability
to work as part of a team. It is for this reason I have participated with zeal
in multiple team-oriented courses and projects and have consistently delivered
finished assignments as per requirements and always within the allotted time
provided.

I have also been able to utilize my diverse technical knowledge while
volunteering in multiple capacities. It is with enthusiasm that I have been
able to gain exposure to multiple technologies, platforms, and operating
languages through the course of my perpetual quest for knowledge.

I am sure after appraisal of my resume you will see I am an individual with
excellent potential in an organization such as {CBT Nuggets}. In addition to
the skills listed, I also have an excellent work ethic, personality and
tenacious attitude. I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

\closing{Sincerely,}
