\opening{Dear Mrs. Smith,} 
 
I am writing to express interest in the Full Stack Software Engineer - CMS
position at your Portland, Oregon location. I learned about your company at the
fall engineering career fair at Oregon State University, which caused me to go
to your website and search your job listings. I am interested in this position
because I am interested in web development. I am also very interested in open
source, and I am glad to see that Say Media contributes to open source projects.
I will be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science from Oregon State
University (OSU) in June 2016, and I would like to be considered for this
position. I have included a comparison of your requirements and my
qualifications below. I have also included my resume for a more information on
my qualifications.

\underline{Requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 3+ years software engineering experience

        I have 3 years of experience working in web development for both Central
        Web Services (CWS) at OSU, as well as at the OSU Open Source Lab (OSL).

  \item Experience in Javascript, Node.js, Angular, and HTML5

        I am a developer for the Timesync time tracking API, which is written in
        Javascript and Node.js.

  \item B.S. Computer Science or equivalent experience

        I will be graduating from OSU with a B.S. in Computer Science in June
        2016.

  \item Good understanding of CMS systems, able to evaluate CMS trade-offs

        I worked with Drupal in both the front end as well as building modules
        for it.

  \item Able to work onsite in Portland, OR

        I will be able to relocate to Portland after I graduate.

  \item Experience in object oriented programming and architectural design
    patterns

        Several classes that I have taken at OSU focus on object oriented
        programming.

  \item Experience working in a company environment involving a product
    management organization, architects, development, and customer-facing
    support

        The organizations that I have worked for are teams that are under the
        umbrella of OSU. My positions have been focused on development.   

  \item Track record of documenting work and developing specifications

        The majority of the projects at the OSL are planned out before
        development begins, and documentation is to be updated before the code
        is.

  \item Bonus: experience in Python

        I have extensive experience working with Python in both a framework such
        as Django as well as writing independent programs.

\end{itemize}

PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its
products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you
are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a
qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience,
point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the
same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the
enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training,
and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by
providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
 
PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as
to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer
assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in
the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up
an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set
up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to
consider your credentials. 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
